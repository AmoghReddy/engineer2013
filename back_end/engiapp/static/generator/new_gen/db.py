"Megapixel": {"image": "engineer.gif","contact": "contact","Description": "Imagine playing Tetris on a screen as big as an 8-floored building. Well, imagine no more, because that’s exactly what Megapixel is. A 32x16 LED screen is hung off a building as the screen with players sitting about half a kilometer away from it. The players get to choose from a wide variety of commonly played video games all coded specifically to fit this screen. The screen is also used for displaying custom messages intended to advertise and publicize other events. The game mechanics involves controlling LED arrays and coding games specific to the event. The Megapixel was initially implemented as a 24x16 LED screen in the year 2011. In the following year, this was improved to a 32x16 screen."},
"Blitzkrieg": {"image": "engineer.gif","contact": "contact","Description": "Blitzkrieg (also Laser Tag) draws inspiration from the popular Laser tag game. It is a team sport where players attempt to score points by tagging opponents with a hand-held IR-emitting laser-targeting device. IR-sensitive targets are worn by each player and points are won by tagging an opponent and lost when tagged. Fluorescent jackets are worn to be spotted in the dark and existing buildings are used as the arena. Each player is given limited lives and shots, after which they need to go to the base station to be revived. The game mechanics mainly involves communication protocols for integration between the player's equipment and devices in the facility."},
"Dance_Dance_Revolution":{"image": "engineer.gif","contact": "contact","Description": "Dance Dance Revolution (also Footloose) abbreviated DDR is a music game where players stand on a 4X4 platform and hit the lit square with their feet to musical cues. Players are judged by how many times they manage to hit the right square in a given period of time. Based on the critically acclaimed music video game series produced by Konami, this game is executed using a wooden platform lit with LEDs and covered with glass integrated with a Linux based GUI for real-time score display. The game mechanics involves random light generation, real time interface and pressure detection for scoring."},
"Agent_Dash": {"image": "engineer.gif","contact": "contact","Description": "Who doesn't love the OO7 style agent of the famous android game AGENT DASH! This event is a virtual game where you are supposed to control your agent in the game by actually moving left or right on the sensor platform. The ultimate goal is to dodge obstacles coming your way ,shoot your enemies & cover the longest distance. "},
"Labyrinth": {"image": "engineer.gif","contact": "contact","Description": "Labyrinth is a game consisting of a maze and a marble the objective of which is to tilt the playfield to guide the marble to the end of the maze. The maze is suspended using the four corners. The player is provided with a keyglove used to control the tilt of the maze by similar palm tilt. The keyglove has an Inertial Measurement Unit (accelerometer and gyroscope devices) which is used to measure the tilt and Xbees to transmit data wirelessly to the control system on the labyrinth. The game mechanics involves tapping the hand tilt of the player and replicating a similar tilt on the playfield. "},
"Pin_Ball": {"image": "engineer.gif","contact": "contact","Description": "A game enjoyed since ages by the young & old alike is now brought out of the screen into the real scenario. The blockers are controlled using levers & the aim of the game is to keep the ball from falling into the pit. "},
"Temple_Run": {"image": "engineer.gif","contact": "contact","Description": "Temple Run, an adventurous game in which the character runs in a jungle avoiding all obstacles. The character is also being chased by a demon & has to avoid being caught. We are implementing the game virtually using Kinect. If you want to experience a real thrilling chase you gotta check this out. "},
"Contraption": {"image": "engineer.gif","contact": "contact","Description": "In the year 2011, Contraption was implemented on a structure that depicted the Engineer logo. In 2012, a mechanical clock was made. This year we bring it back bigger than ever."},
"Strongman": {"image": "engineer.gif","contact": "contact","Description": "Strongman is an exhibitor of strength and this game is everyone’s chance at that. It consists of a tower of LEDs, lit according to how hard the player manages to whack a given spot with a hammer. As opposed to the ones used in funfair and carnivals, this game uses pressure sensors to determine the force of the blow. When all the LEDs are lit, the player wins. The game mechanics involves controlling the number of rows of LEDs lit according to the sensor measurements. "},
"Shadow_LED": {"image": "engineer.gif","contact": "contact","Description": "Shadow LED is an LED panel that shows one’s shadow. When the person stands in front of it, the LEDs light up to display his/her shadow. Swing your arms, move about, walk away and it does exactly that. This event involves image processing and controlling LED arrays. "},
"Waterfall": {"image": "engineer.gif","contact": "contact","Description": "Waterfall is a part of the Psychedelic Room. It displays visualizations synchronized with the music being played in the room. The waterfall has columns with three levels of LED rows and is filled with thermocol balls and fan underneath. These fans rotate according to the music being played so as to control how high the thermocol balls fly and the LEDs light accordingly make it look like an equalizer. It involves signal (sound) processing and controlling the fan rotation. Inclusion of LED rows was a development from the year 2011 to 2012, other than implementation on a sturdier mechanical structure. "},
"Decagon": {"image": "engineer.gif","contact": "contact","Description": "DECAGON is part of the Psychedelic Room and hence is music synchronized. It is an 8x8x8 3D LED cube which displays visualizations that change with the music playing in the room. These visualizations are 3-dimensional and hence make it way cooler than any visualization you’ve seen before. It involves sound (signal) processing, multiplexing LEDs and building the structure (cube of LEDs) in itself. The second time Octet was implemented, it was improved structurally. A sophisticated coding system was developed and the platform was changed to MSP430F1612 from Arduino. Better patterns were implemented with the new system put in place. "},
"Liquid_Light": {"image": "engineer.gif","contact": "contact","Description": "Liquid Light is made up of an RGB LED screen. It consists of various touch points. When touched, it creates an explosion of colourful patterns similar to the ripple effect from touching water. It involves detecting touch, algorithms to create patterns and controlling LED arrays. "},
"Light_Wall": {"image": "engineer.gif","contact": "contact","Description": "The Light Wall forms the coruscating backdrop of the Psychedelic Room. The lights flash in synchronization with the music being played in the room. The blue lights that cover one of the walls and the borders of the rest ensure visualizations that are spectacular. "},
"Theremin": {"image": "engineer.gif","contact": "contact","Description": "The Theremin is an early instrument played without touching. It consists of two antennas, one to control pitch and the other to control amplitude. Along the same lines, the Theremin implemented is modeled as a butler, with sensors for hands, depicted as vocalizing according to the user’s movements. Instead of the antennas, here, the distance of the user’s hands from the two sensors control the pitch and the amplitude. It also consists of two knobs to control mode and volume. The game mechanics involves sensing motion and using that as a basis to emit sounds. "},
"Laser_Harp":{"image": "engineer.gif","contact": "contact","Description": "Laser harp is an engineer’s attempt to draw analogy with the musical instrument harp. Being a high profile feature of concerts of famous musicians, here, laser beams are blocked instead of plucking strings and sound is emitted by detecting which laser was blocked using sensors. The game mechanics involve accurate alignment of the laser and sensor placed on opposite ends of the harp and producing sound of various frequencies according to the laser beam blocked. "}
