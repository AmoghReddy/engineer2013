The difference at Engineer is that,the FOX is a Radio Transmitter and the HUNTERS are budding communication engineers.<br/>Participants are required to track down a transmitter (FOX) that could be situated anywhere in the campus, using a tunable radio receiver and an antenna built by them, making the event full of fun and excitement.<br/><b>EVENT FORMAT</b><br/>The event will have two phases <br/>-FM reception stage(Phase 1)<br/> -HAM reception stage(Phase 2)<br/>Phase 1<br/>All the participating teams are required to build an FM receiver circuit (with an antenna, if required) for Phase 1.<br/>The participating teams which qualify Phase 1 are then allowed to participate in Phase 2.<br/><b>Judging criteria:</b><br/>Clarity of reception of FM.<br/>Cost.<br/>Points will be deducted for using ready-made printed circuit boards.<br/>Any extra innovations on the circuit (example- a mechanism to switch between FM and HAM reception) will be rewarded with extra points.<br/>Any antennas to aid FM reception are encouraged, however they won’t independently carry a point weight age and can aid in clarity of reception.<br/><b>EVENT RULES</b><br/>Each team can consist of a maximum of 4 members.<br/>The members of each team can be from different colleges.<br/>Participating teams those qualify Phase 1 will only be allowed to participate in Phase 2.<br/>Only one antenna will be provided to the participating teams, who have qualified for phase 2 but are not able to design on their own.<br/>The decision of the judges will be the absolute authority.<br/><b>DISQUALIFICATIONS</b><br/>Things that amount to disqualification<br/>Usage of a commercial antenna.<br/>Usage of mobile phones or other means of communication between teams during the final event.<br/>Usage of FM transmitters in the range 144-146 MHz<br/>Downloads:<br/></p></div>
