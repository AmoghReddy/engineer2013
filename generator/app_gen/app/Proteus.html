Provision to make modifications during a trial is not permitted.</p></div><div data-role="collapsible"><h3>BOT SPECS</h3><p>• Bots may be wired or wireless.<br/>• Controlling wires (if any) should not be taut at any point during the trial.<br/>• The bot has to fit in a box of dimensions 30*30*30 cm3<br/>• The width of the flume is 72cm. There are no other dimensional restrictions on the width or length. Keep in mind the functional requirements of the bot.<br/>• No restriction on weight of bot.<br/>• The potential difference between any two points on the bot must not exceed 12V.<br/>• Electrical components must be adequately insulated to prevent any complications <br/>that could arise because of it coming in contact with water.</p></div><div data-role="collapsible"><h3>EVENT FORMAT</h3><p>• Round 1<br/>The bot has to start from point A and travel along the length of the tank to point B. At point B, the bot has to take a turn and then reach point C. The time taken to reach here is noted as t1.At point C, it is required to shoot a jet of water to achieve maximum range (R). Look at the figure below for reference.<br/>• Round 2<br/>The participants are supposed to aim and shoot maximum of the three targets placed at gradually increasing heights at different distances. The details of the targets are shown below. The maximum time allotted to each team is 6 minutes. If all the targets are destroyed, the time remaining is also taken into account for the scoring system. The targets have to be destroyed in the following sequence- A –B - C</p></div><div data-role="collapsible"><h3>SCORING</h3><p>Time taken in round 1 = t1<br/>Time taken for destroying target 1 = t2 (seconds)<br/>Time taken for destroying target 2 = t3 (seconds)<br/>Time taken for destroying target 3 = t4 (seconds) <br/>T4 will be calculated only after all three targets have been brought down.<br/>Time remaining after all the targets have been destroyed = t5 (seconds)<br/>Range of the jet in round 1 = R (cm)<br/>FIRST ROUND EVALUATION:<br/>S1 = 2 * R * ( 1 / t1 )<br/>Based on S1, top eight teams are qualified for the next round and awarded points from 40 to 5 (40, 35, 30 .. and so on). These points are carried forward for the final score.<br/>Final Score, S = ( ( 1000 / t2 ) + ( 2000 / t3 ) + ( 3000 / t4 ) ) * exp( ts / 100 )  + (Points carried forward from the first round)</p></div><div data-role="collapsible"><h3>DOWNLOAD</h3><p><p><b>Video: </b><a href='http://youtu.be/Oz2YhPmACBA' target='_blank'>http://youtu.be/Oz2YhPmACBA</a><br/><a href='data/proteus.pdf'>Download</a></p></p></div>
