It is a team sport where players attempt to score points by tagging opponents with a hand-held IR-emitting laser-targeting device. IR-sensitive targets are worn by each player and points are won by tagging an opponent and lost when tagged. Fluorescent jackets are worn to be spotted in the dark and existing buildings are used as the arena. Each player is given limited lives and shots, after which they need to go to the base station to be revived. The game mechanics mainly involves communication protocols for integration between the player's equipment and devices in the facility.</p></div>
