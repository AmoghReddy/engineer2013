In the past we have managed to interact with individuals like John C. Mather, who won the Nobel Prize in Physics for his work on <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_Background_Explorer'>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_Background_Explorer</a>, Bjarne Stroustrup who was the creator C,C++, Sam Pitroda who has been the advisor to the Prime Minister of India on public information infrastructure.<br/>This year the aim of TechSpeak is to showcase speakers who can give viewers a precious insight into what the world needs from engineers and what engineers can do for the world. <br/>"I think I would say that the universe has a purpose, it's not somehow just there by chance ... some people, I think, take the view that the universe is just there and it runs along â€“ it's a bit like it just sort of computes, and we happen somehow by accident to find ourselves in this thing. But I don't think that's a very fruitful or helpful way of looking at the universe, I think that there is something much deeper about it." - Roger Penrose</p></div><div data-role="collapsible"><h3>Schedule</h3><p class='divContentWhite'> <b> Banibrata Mukopadhyay</b><br/><img src='static/bbmukhopadhyay.jpg'><br/> - Associate Professor of Astrophysics at IISC, Bangalore. He calculated the mass limit to which white dwarf stars can reach, before they collapse into neutron stars or black holes. Refuting previously believed limit that was proposed by Chandrasekhar. (Oct. 26th 4.30pm - 6.00pm)<br/>2. <b>Max Little </b><br/><img src='static/Max-Little.jpg'><br/>- Wellcome Trust/MIT Fellow and TED Fellow. Mathematician with a background in applied mathematics, statistics, signal processing and computational engineering. Research work has been applied to problems in biomedicine (such as monitoring of Parkinson's disease and voice pathologies), extreme rainfall analysis and forecasting, biophysical signal processing, and hydrogeomorphology and open channel flow measurement. (Oct. 25th 7.30pm - 8.30pm)<br/>3. <b>K. VijayRaghavan</b><br/><img src='static/vijay-raghavan-new.jpg'><br/> - Director of The National Centre for Biological Sciences. He is the recipient of the Infosys Prize in the life sciences (2009) and was conferred the honour of the Padma Shri in 2013. His fields of specialization are Developmental Biology, Genetics and Neurogenetics. His research primarily focuses on the important principles and mechanisms that control nervous systems and muscles during development. (Oct. 27th 3.30pm - 4.30pm)</p></div>
