In the past we have managed to interact with individuals like John C. Mather, who won the Nobel Prize in Physics for his work on <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_Background_Explorer'>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_Background_Explorer</a>, Bjarne Stroustrup who was the creator C,C++, Sam Pitroda who has been the advisor to the Prime Minister of India on public information infrastructure.<br/>This year the aim of TechSpeak is to showcase speakers who can give viewers a precious insight into what the world needs from engineers and what engineers can do for the world. <br/>"I think I would say that the universe has a purpose, it's not somehow just there by chance ... some people, I think, take the view that the universe is just there and it runs along â€“ it's a bit like it just sort of computes, and we happen somehow by accident to find ourselves in this thing. But I don't think that's a very fruitful or helpful way of looking at the universe, I think that there is something much deeper about it." - Roger Penrose</p></div><div data-role="collapsible"><h3>SCHEDULE</h3><p><b>Dr VijayRaghavan (Padma Shri)</b><br/> Venue: ATB seminar hall<br/> Time:15.30 - 17.30<br/><br/><b>Dr. Banibrata Mukhopadhyay (Astro Talk)</b><br/>Venue: ATB seminar hall<br/>Time:afternoon<br/><br/>More to be announced soon</p></div>
