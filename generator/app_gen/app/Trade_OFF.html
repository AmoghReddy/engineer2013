No credit will be given for design alone. The amount to be added will be decided based on the quality of the result obtained and the discretion of the judges.<br/>Half the cost of the component will be credited (as virtual money) on returning unused component.<br/>Technical help, if required can also be obtained at the cost of virtual money.<br/>Teams will NOT be allowed to carry their own personal components to the event. All the components required for the event will be provided by the organizers.<br/><b>GENERAL INFORMATION</b><br/>Team size: Three(maximum) <br/>Resources<br/>Datasheets for all the components required will be provided.<br/> <b>Useful Knowledge</b><br/>Basics of Analog Electronic Circuits: Transistors, OPAMPs, 555 timers, etc.<br/>Basics of Digital Electronic Circuits: TTL gates, adders, flip-flops etc.<br/>Analog Communication: Simple modulator-demodulator circuits<br/><b>JUDGING CRITERIA</b><br/>The output of the circuit will be evaluated.<br/>In case of a tie, time required to build the circuit will be considered.<br/>The team with the highest amount of virtual money in their account at the end of the event will be declared as the winner.<br/>Judges' decision will be final and binding in all cases.<br/></p></div>
