Any team that is not ready at the time specified will be disqualified from the competition and the opponent robot will be declared the winner.<br/>A robot that is deemed unsafe by the judges after the match has begun will be disqualified. The match will be immediately halted and the opponent will be awarded a win.<br/>If the robots fail to contact each other for 60 seconds, both the robots will be eliminated.<br/>The arena will have an opening through which bots can be pushed off the arena. <br/>The robot will be declared victorious if it pushes the opponent off the arena through the opening in the wall twice.<br/>In case a robot falls off the arena or toppled during the match, it can be restored back to the start point by a team member, within 30 seconds, during which the opponent can move in the arena but not make contact with the other robot. Only 1 restore will be allowed per team.<br/>The robot has to maintain a minimum distance of 60 cm from the opponent during its restore.<br/>The robots are not allowed to cut the opponent&rsquo;s control wires. Violation of this rule will lead to disqualification.<br/>In case of immobility of any of the bots, both the bots will start again from their start points. <br/>Pinning is allowed only in the specified pin zone and the points will be awarded only for first two pinning in the match. The bots again start from their start points.<br/>Prizes:<br/> 1st: Rs. 10,000<br/> 2nd: Rs. 7,000<br/> 3rd: Rs. 5,000<br/><b>Schedule</b><br/> Day 2 (25) Sports complex</p></div><div data-role="collapsible"><h3>Judging</h3><p class='divContentWhite'>Points will be awarded by the judges to a robot only if it has a considerable impact/damage on the opponent&rsquo;s robot. (Definition of damage will be decided by the judge and will be binding to all. NO discussion will be entertained)<br/>In case none of the robots are completely damaged, the robot with maximum number of points will be declared the winner.<br/>No points will be awarded for immobilizing the opponent bot.<br/>Points will be awarded for the team for using the offensive mechanisms provided by the organizers.<br/></p></div><div data-role="collapsible"><h3>Arenaspecs</h3><p class='divContentWhite'>The arena will be a circular wooden board of diameter 8 ft. <br/>The arena will have 3 ft high mesh all around it except an opening through which the robots can be pushed out of the arena <br/>The arena may have one or more of the following traps:<br/>Reciprocating Platform with about 1 &ndash; 20 reciprocations per minute.<br/>Rotating Platform of about 30 &ndash; 300 rpm.<br/>Lifting Mechanisms.<br/>Sand/Gravel/ Slush Pits of dimensions 70 cm x 70 cm. Depth of the pits from the arena surface are at an average of 3cm.&#160;<br/>Corrugations with a maximum radius of 10cm and pitch 20 cm.<br/>Rollers with a maximum diameter of 6 cm.<br/>Hitting Mechanisms.<br/>Heavy Oscillating Metal Balls<br/></p></div><div data-role="collapsible"><h3>Mobility</h3><p class='divContentWhite'>All robots must have easily visible and controlled mobility in order to compete.<br/>Any machine component should not be detached (intentionally) during any point of the war.<br/>The maximum power limitation for mobility is 150 W. However there is no power limitation for attack mechanism.<br/>Methods of Mobility include:<br/>Rolling (wheels, tracks or the whole robot)<br/>Walking (linear actuated legs with no rolling or cam operated motion).<br/>Shuffling(rotational cam operated legs)<br/>Jumping and hopping is not allowed<br/>Flying (airfoil using, helium balloons, ornithopters, hovercrafts etc.) is not allowed.<br/></p></div><div data-role="collapsible"><h3>Botspecs</h3><p class='divContentWhite'>Initial dimension of the robot should not exceed 50cm x 50cm x 50cm (l x b x h).The external device used to control the machine or any external tank is not included in the size constraint.<br/>Weight of the robot should not exceed 20kg (Excluding remote control and control wires).<br/>If the robot uses external pneumatic / hydraulic source tank, its weight would not be considered.<br/>If the robot is solely powered by onboard batteries (wireless robots), its weight would be considered 0.8 times its actual weight.<br/>The bot should contain an attack mechanism. Attack mechanism should be independent of the motion of the bot i.e. it should work even if the bot is motionless. A separate check of the attack mechanism will be conducted when the bot is immobile.<br/>The robot should have a small ground clearance such that the arena is not damaged at any point of time. The bot which causes any damage to arena will be disqualified.<br/></p></div><div data-role="collapsible"><h3>Hydraulic</h3><p class='divContentWhite'>Participants can use pneumatic and hydraulic weapon systems.<br/>The outlet pressure of the source/tank should not exceed 8 bars. The used pressure should be indicated by means of temporarily fitted pressure gauge or there should be a provision to measure the cylinder pressure on the bot.<br/>Robots can use pressurized, non-inflammable gases/liquid to initialize their pneumatic mechanisms.<br/>Teams have to bring their own cylinders. Organizers will not provide any kind of refilling.<br/>Weight of the external cylinders are not taken into account.<br/></p></div><div data-role="collapsible"><h3>Power</h3><p class='divContentWhite'>Both on and off board power supplies are allowed. Batteries must be sealed, immobilized-electrolyte types (such as gel cells, lithium, NiCad, NiMH, or dry cells).<br/>The voltage between any two terminals in the robot should not exceed 25V. There is no restriction on the power consumption of the bot.<br/>230V AC power will be provided.<br/>Participants can make use of one or more DC/Stepper motors.<br/>Use of an IC engine in any form is not allowed.<br/>If the robot is wired then the wire should remain slack under all circumstances during the competition. The length of the wire between controlling device &amp; the power supply and between machine &amp; controlling device should be at least 4 meters.<br/></p></div><div data-role="collapsible"><h3>Weapon</h3><p class='divContentWhite'>The bots must have at least one kind of attack mechanism. Defensive bots like Wedge bots will be disqualified.<br/>Robots can have any kind of magnetic weapons, cutters, flippers, saws, lifting devices, spinning hammers etc. as weapons with following exceptions and limitations:<br/>Liquid projectiles.<br/>Any kind of inflammable liquid.<br/>Flame-based weapons.<br/>Electro-Magnetic Pulse.<br/>Any kind of explosive or intentionally ignited solid or potentially ignitable solid.<br/>Nets, tape, glue, or any other entanglement device or adhesives.<br/>High power magnets or electromagnets.<br/>Radio jamming, tazers, tesla coils, or any other high-voltage device.<br/>Un-tethered projectiles.&#160;<br/>Tethered projectiles in any direction with each having a maximum tether length of 1m are allowed.&#160;<br/>Spinning weapons which do not come in contact with the arena at no point of time are allowed. In no case should the arena be damaged by any bot. Violation of this rule will lead to immediate disqualification.&#160;<br/></p></div><div data-role="collapsible"><h3>Safety</h3><p class='divContentWhite'>Compliance with all event rules is mandatory. It is expected that competitors stay within the rules and procedures of their own accord and do not require constant policing.<br/>If you have a robot or weapon design that does not fit within the categories set forth in the above said rules or is in some way ambiguous or borderline, please contact the event organizers.<br/>Safe innovation is always encouraged, but surprising the event staff with your brilliant exploitation of a loophole may cause your robot to be disqualified before it even competes.<br/>Each event has safety inspections. It is at the judge&rsquo;s sole discretion that your robot is allowed to compete. As a builder you are obligated to disclose all operating principles and potential dangers to the inspection staff.<br/>Proper activation and deactivation of robots is critical. Robots must only be activated in the arena, testing areas, or with express consent of the event coordinators.<br/>All weapons must have a safety cover on any sharp edges.<br/>All participants build and operate robots at their own risk. Combat robotics is inherently dangerous. There is no amount of regulation that can encompass all the dangers involved.<br/>Please take care to not hurt yourself or others when building, testing and competing.<br/></p></div><div data-role="collapsible"><h3>Download</h3><p class='divContentWhite'><a href='data/robowars.docx'>Download</a></p></div>
