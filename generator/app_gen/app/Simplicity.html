MATLAB is a very effective development tool for performing computationally intensive tasks quickly and easily. MATLAB builds the bridge between the human thought and implementation in mathematics.<br/>If you think you are second to none when it comes to coding in MATLAB then Simplicity is the right place to prove yourself.<br/>Starting from simple math problems to image and audio processing,<br/>simplicity questions interests everyone from novice to expert.<br/> Being one-of-a-kind online programming contest, Simplicity<br/>sees amateur to professional participants from around the world<br/>trying to crack problems in various fields of mathematics,<br/>science and engineering.<br/><b>Trial Run:</b> 20th October<br/><b>Event:</b> 21th October 4:00PM to 10:00PM <br/><b>Event URL:</b> <a href = 'http://simplicity.engineer.org.in'> Simplicity </a><br/> </p></div><div data-role="collapsible"><h3>EVENT FORMAT AND RULES</h3><p>This is an online team event<br/>Each team consists of 3 members<br/>The problems will not be specific to any particular domain of engineering, they will rather be based on fundamental mathematics and basic engineering<br/>The event will be of 8 hour duration.<br/>The solutions to the each question has to be uploaded for evaluationPoints will be awarded after evaluation of submitted solutions.<br/><b>EVENT RULES</b><br/>Codes have to be submitted in the form of MATLAB .m files with specific format.<br/>The format will be specified along with each question.<br/>Participants may upload answer to problems any number of times.<br/>Uploading codes intended to harm the server, will earn disqualification.<br/>The submitted source code will be checked if it is copied. Any copying of code would lead to immediate disqualification of both the codes in doubt.<br/></p></div><div data-role="collapsible"><h3>SCORING CRITERIA</h3><p>The evaluation of the codes is done automatically by a MATLAB server.<br/>Points are allotted based on the performance of the solution to different test cases.<br/>The participants may submit the codes as many times before the final deadline. The codes last submitted will be judged.<br/>In case of a tie, the total login time will be considered.<br/>The organizers decision will be final and binding.<br/></p></div>
