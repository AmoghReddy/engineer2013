With the customer&rsquo;s booking times less than one hour before the customer's arrival time, zeat.in's source of income comes from the restaurants which are featured on its website. For every booking via zeat.in, the restaurant pays zeat.in a pre-decided percentage of the customer's bill. Currently working and functioning in Bangalore and New Delhi, zeat.in features some of the most highly rated restaurants in these two metropolitan cities, where most people have started being tech-savvy. To provide incentives for customers to book via zeat.in, they have now started providing discount coupons to people who book via zeat.in. Facing stiff competition from competitors like Groupon and many bigger companies, who have long-standing brand names in the coupon distribution business, zeat.in needs to formulate a marketing strategy for:<br/><br/>(i) Distributing maximum number of coupons and ensuring the use of the distributed coupons (which would otherwise go waste, as there are limited coupons)<br/><br/>(ii) Ensuring customers book using zeat.in irrespective of discount coupons<br/><br/>Zeat.in's current strategy relies solely on social media marketing and they are in the process of building an android application for smart phone booking.</p></div>
