For much of history he has been trying to conquer this seemingly unbeatable foe. The skies continued to elude him until finally, the Wright brothers finally conquered the skies one windy morning in the winter of 1903. Since then the aircraft industry has exploded, and aero planes have captured the imagination of the human race.<br/> This workshop by <a href='http://www.aerotrix.com/'' target='_blank' ><b>AerotriX</b></a> gives the participants an opportunity to understand the theory behind the functioning of aircrafts and aircraft design. It makes the participants innovate by coming up with their own design of mini aircrafts and fabricating them as per their design. This workshop takes the participants through a series of interactive lectures and design sessions supplemented by practical sessions, thereby providing a complete learning experience.<br/> Video: <a href='http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyL7bv9RGRU' target='_blank' >http://www.youtube.com/watch?<wbr>v=gyL7bv9RGRU</a> </p></div><div data-role="collapsible"><h3>Workshop specialties</h3><p class='divContentWhite'><b>Workshop Specialties</b>:  • No pre-designed kits are given to participants. Participants design their own aircrafts (using hand calculation and software) under the guidance of our professionals which are later fabricated by them. <br/>• The workshop is organized personally by IIT Kanpur Aerospace Engineering Graduates </p></div><div data-role="collapsible"><h3>Workshop structure</h3><p class='divContentWhite'>The workshop is divided into 4 modules: • Understanding Flight <br/>• Design of Aircraft <br/> • Fabrication of Aircraft <br/>• Flying using Remote Control <br/>Three awards will be given to the participating teams in terms of Best Design, Best Fabrication and Innovation. The names of the recipients will be put up on our website permanently and they will also be provided with certificate of merit. For our previous workshops awards, check www.aerotrix.com/participant-awards</p></div><div data-role="collapsible"><h3>Kit contents</h3><p class='divContentWhite'>• Hardware • Engine/ Electric Motor * • Electric Motor Controller * • Propeller * <br/> • Transmitter * • Receiver * • Li-Po battery * • Servo motors (3 pieces) * <br/> • Landing Gear ( main and tail dragger) • Wheels (2 pieces) • Coroplast • Styrofoam <br/> • Control Rods • Epoxy Glue • Wing Holders • Working Tools ^ <br/> • Other miscellaneous items The parts marked * are not part of standard kit.
