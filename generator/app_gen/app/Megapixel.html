Well, imagine no more, because thatâ€™s exactly what Megapixel is. A 32x16 LED screen is hung off a building as the screen with players sitting about half a kilometer away from it. The players get to choose from a wide variety of commonly played video games all coded specifically to fit this screen. The screen is also used for displaying custom messages intended to advertise and publicize other events. The game mechanics involves controlling LED arrays and coding games specific to the event. The Megapixel was initially implemented as a 24x16 LED screen in the year 2011. In the following year, this was improved to a 32x16 screen.</p></div>
