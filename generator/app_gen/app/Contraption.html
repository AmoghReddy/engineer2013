With vast number of people dependant on coastal areas for fishing and tourism throughout the world, consequences of oil spills can be serious. Oil companies and ship builders shoulder the responsibility to prevent these disasters. Most man made oil pollution comes from land based activities. But public attention tends to focus more sharply on sea going oil tankers. In general, lighter refined petroleum products like diesel and gasoline are more likely to mix in water and are more toxic to marine life. These products evaporate quickly and do not persist long in the environment. However, heavier crude oil of less toxicity can remain on water surface for much longer period. As oil is lighter than water and doesn&rsquo;t decompose, it will remain on the surface for a very long time. As it is flammable, spills can also fuel ocean fires. <br/>For this year&rsquo;s edition of Engineer, Contraption provides an opportunity for participants to furnish innovative solutions for oil spills on a miniature scale, based on the criteria in Problem Statement.<br/></p></div><div data-role="collapsible"><h3>PROBLEM STATEMENT</h3><p>A pond of water having an exposed surface area of 0.25 m2 is covered by a layer of oil. Participants are required to come up with a mechanism that will recover the oil layer from the water. Dimensions of the model, as viewed from above should not exceed 25 cm x 25 cm over the surface of the pond. There is no constraint on the material of construction or the height of the model.<br/></p></div><div data-role="collapsible"><h3>RULES</h3><p>• The students must carry valid student ID cards of their college which they will be required to produce at the time of registration. <br/>• A team may comprise a maximum of four participants. Readymade kits are NOT allowed. Judges decision in this regard will be final and binding. <br/>• Teams will not be allowed to modify their model during their trial. <br/>• The initial model dimensions should not exceed 25 cm x 25 cm excluding the height and control device dimensions. This dimension excludes the pneumatic or hydraulic pumps, if used. <br/>• The weight of the model should not exceed 10 kgs. <br/>• The model can be controlled wirelessly or with wires. <br/>• Readymade wireless remote control units may be used. <br/>• In case wired control is used, the wire(s) must remain slack throughout the event. If the wires are visibly taut, the team would be immediately disqualified. <br/>• Single phase external 230V AC power will be supplied. Maximum voltage between any two points on the modelmust not exceed 24 V DC or 24 V AC. <br/>• Maximum power consumption should not exceed 200W.</p></div>
