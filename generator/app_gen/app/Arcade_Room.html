This event is a virtual game where you are supposed to control your agent in the game by actually moving left or right on the sensor platform. The ultimate goal is to dodge obstacles coming your way ,shoot your enemies & cover the longest distance. </p></div><div data-role="collapsible"><h3>LABYRINTH</h3><p>Labyrinth is a game consisting of a maze and a marble the objective of which is to tilt the playfield to guide the marble to the end of the maze. The maze is suspended using the four corners. The player is provided with a keyglove used to control the tilt of the maze by similar palm tilt. The keyglove has an Inertial Measurement Unit (accelerometer and gyroscope devices) which is used to measure the tilt and Xbees to transmit data wirelessly to the control system on the labyrinth. The game mechanics involves tapping the hand tilt of the player and replicating a similar tilt on the playfield. </p></div><div data-role="collapsible"><h3>PIN_BALL</h3><p>A game enjoyed since ages by the young & old alike is now brought out of the screen into the real scenario. The blockers are controlled using levers & the aim of the game is to keep the ball from falling into the pit. </p></div><div data-role="collapsible"><h3>TEMPLE_RUN</h3><p>Temple Run, an adventurous game in which the character runs in a jungle avoiding all obstacles. The character is also being chased by a demon & has to avoid being caught. We are implementing the game virtually using Kinect. If you want to experience a real thrilling chase you gotta check this out. </p></div><div data-role="collapsible"><h3>CONTRAPTION</h3><p>In the year 2011, Contraption was implemented on a structure that depicted the Engineer logo. In 2012, a mechanical clock was made. This year we bring it back bigger than ever.</p></div><div data-role="collapsible"><h3>STRONGMAN</h3><p>Strongman is an exhibitor of strength and this game is everyone’s chance at that. It consists of a tower of LEDs, lit according to how hard the player manages to whack a given spot with a hammer. As opposed to the ones used in funfair and carnivals, this game uses pressure sensors to determine the force of the blow. When all the LEDs are lit, the player wins. The game mechanics involves controlling the number of rows of LEDs lit according to the sensor measurements. </p></div><div data-role="collapsible"><h3>SHADOW_LED</h3><p>Shadow LED is an LED panel that shows one’s shadow. When the person stands in front of it, the LEDs light up to display his/her shadow. Swing your arms, move about, walk away and it does exactly that. This event involves image processing and controlling LED arrays. </p></div><div data-role="collapsible"><h3>LIQUID_LIGHT</h3><p>Liquid Light is made up of an RGB LED screen. It consists of various touch points. When touched, it creates an explosion of colourful patterns similar to the ripple effect from touching water. It involves detecting touch, algorithms to create patterns and controlling LED arrays. </p></div><div data-role="collapsible"><h3>THEREMIN</h3><p>The Theremin is an early instrument played without touching. It consists of two antennas, one to control pitch and the other to control amplitude. Along the same lines, the Theremin implemented is modeled as a butler, with sensors for hands, depicted as vocalizing according to the user’s movements. Instead of the antennas, here, the distance of the user’s hands from the two sensors control the pitch and the amplitude. It also consists of two knobs to control mode and volume. The game mechanics involves sensing motion and using that as a basis to emit sounds. </p></div><div data-role="collapsible"><h3>LASER_HARP</h3><p>Laser harp is an engineer’s attempt to draw analogy with the musical instrument harp. Being a high profile feature of concerts of famous musicians, here, laser beams are blocked instead of plucking strings and sound is emitted by detecting which laser was blocked using sensors. The game mechanics involve accurate alignment of the laser and sensor placed on opposite ends of the harp and producing sound of various frequencies according to the laser beam blocked. </p></div>
