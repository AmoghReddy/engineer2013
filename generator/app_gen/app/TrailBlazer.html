A person who makes a new track through wild country.<br/>2. A pioneer; an innovator<br/>A simple event based on line follower robotics.<br/>You are required to build a line follower robot. <br/> Participate in this innovative event and hone your robotic skills.<br/><b>Winners of this event gets an intern opportunity at Adormi Tech.</b></p></div><div data-role="collapsible"><h3>GOAL</h3><p>Teams must build a line following bot that navigates the path in minimum possible time while remembering the turns taken.<br/> After tracing the entire path, we expect bot to display the order of turns taken (in case of the path in the shown sample arena: L-R-R-L-L-R-R-R-L-L-L-R-R-R-L-L-R-R-R-L-L-R-R where L stands for left turn and R stands for right turn).<br/> Bot could use any convenient mechanism to display the final output.</p></div><div data-role="collapsible"><h3>BOTSPECS</h3><p>Bot should not use readymade sensors. Teams are expected to build their own sensors<br/>Bot dimensions should be well within 20cm*18cm<br/>Bot wheels should not hamper the arena <br/>Bot should have a mechanism to show the traced path.</p></div><div data-role="collapsible"><h3>OTHERDETAILS</h3><p><ul><li>A maximum of 4 members may be present in one team.</li><li>Total time allotted is 10 minutes.</li><li>Each team will be given 10 minutes in which they can start the<br/> attempt a maximum of 3 times of which the best time of completion will <br/>be recorded for the results.</li><li>The robot may not deviate completely from the path at any time.</li><li>The robot is expected to stop automatically at the end of the path which is going to be a circle of same colour as the line preceding it.</li></ul></p></div><div data-role="collapsible"><h3>CONTESTPROCEDURE</h3><p><ul><li>The arena layout will not be shown until all the robots are given to the committee.</li><li>However a small sample arena will be available before the contest for calibration and testing.</li><li>The test arena will be made of same materials as the full-size and will be placed in similar lighting conditions.</li><li>After the arena is revealed, no modifications of any type may be made to the robots, including software or hardware changes.</li><li>When it is the turn for the team, a total of 10 min will be given.</li><li>In the given 10 min the person may calibrate the robot within a given time of 1 min.</li><li>The team will have a maximum of three attempts within given 10 mins.</li><li>In case no team is able to complete the path, the judges will decide upon the winner.</li><li>Judges' decision will be final and binding in all cases.</li></p></div><div data-role="collapsible"><h3>SAMPLEARENA</h3><p><img src="./data/trail.png" /></p></div><div data-role="collapsible"><h3>ARENA</h3><p>• The arena comprises of black path on a white background.<br/>• All turnings are 90 degree. <br/>• A black circle of radius 7.5 cm, indicated the end of the path. <br/>• Black line has a uniform thickness of 3cm.<br/>• Dimensions: The arena will be of dimensions no more than 210cm X 190 cm</p></div>
