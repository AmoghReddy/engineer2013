The lights flash in synchronization with the music being played in the room. The blue lights that cover one of the walls and the borders of the rest ensure visualizations that are spectacular. </p></div><div data-role="collapsible"><h3>DECAGON</h3><p>DECAGON is part of the Psychedelic Room and hence is music synchronized. It is an 8x8x8 3D LED cube which displays visualizations that change with the music playing in the room. These visualizations are 3-dimensional and hence make it way cooler than any visualization youâ€™ve seen before. It involves sound (signal) processing, multiplexing LEDs and building the structure (cube of LEDs) in itself. The second time Octet was implemented, it was improved structurally. A sophisticated coding system was developed and the platform was changed to MSP430F1612 from Arduino. Better patterns were implemented with the new system put in place. </p></div><div data-role="collapsible"><h3>WATERFALL</h3><p>Waterfall is a part of the Psychedelic Room. It displays visualizations synchronized with the music being played in the room. The waterfall has columns with three levels of LED rows and is filled with thermocol balls and fan underneath. These fans rotate according to the music being played so as to control how high the thermocol balls fly and the LEDs light accordingly make it look like an equalizer. It involves signal (sound) processing and controlling the fan rotation. Inclusion of LED rows was a development from the year 2011 to 2012, other than implementation on a sturdier mechanical structure. </p></div>
