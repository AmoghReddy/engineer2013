However, workshops generally don't teach you to build such amazing robots. For the very first time in Engineer we will be conducting a workshop where we will be building a bipedal robot which can perform the above tasks. The workshop will be conducted by Frugal Labs who are based in Bangalore.</br>			Registration Fee:  Rs 7000/ team. </br>Each team can have a maximum of 5 members (1400/head). A kit will be provided to each team.</p>	</p></div>
