Original path <br/>2. Shortcut path <br/>The original path involves only wall switching at check-lines (except for the 3rdcheck-line which needs to be ignored) and a single type of ‘L’ shaped corners. <br/>The shortcut path is similar to the original path, but involves negotiation of a left-turn at the 3rd check-line to follow the wall including the familiar ‘L’ shaped 90 degree turn.</p></div><div data-role="collapsible"><h3>ARENA</h3><p>1. The arena comprises of 15cm high walls in the form of a small maze. The wall will be inwhite color. <br/>2. The track may contain the following elements <br/>a) Straight Stretches <br/>b) 90 degree turns.<br/>c) Check-lines: White strips perpendicular to the direction of navigation indicating wallswitch. <br/>3. The base of the arena is painted in black except for the check-lines. <br/>4. A shortcutroute (the third white strip from entrance) is also provided for teams which can <br/>use it as a shortcut to finish the maze faster. <br/>5. The check-lines, of thickness 3 cmare provided at place where there are two walls on either sides of the check-line.  <br/>6. <b>Dimensions:</b> The arena will be of dimensions no more than 290cm X 250 cm (including allwall thickness) with the space between any two walls being 40cm exactly(bot navigation width)<br/>The top view of the wall maze is shown below<br/><img src='./data/waltz.jpg' /><b>Index:</b><br/>Green arrow- Entrance<br/>Orange arrow- Exit for shortcut path<br/>Blue Arrow- Exit for Original path</p></div><div data-role="collapsible"><h3>BOT SPECIFICATION AND RULES</h3><p><ul><li>The bot should fit in a box of dimensions 18 x 18 x 12 (cm).</li><li>The bot must switch at the check-lines (except the 3rd check-line) where the participating team must take the appropriate decision to use the shortcut or the original path.</li><li>If the bot fails to follow the correct wall or strays into an ambiguous path at any point of time during the run, it will be placed just after the previous check-line it has successfully negotiated.
