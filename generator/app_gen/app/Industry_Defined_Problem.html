Aiming to bridge the gap between theory and practice by challenging engineers to come up with innovative and creative solutions to crucial real life industrial problems IDP has been serving as a platform for budding engineers to interact with experts from premier industries around the country, and has been well appreciated by the faculty and students alike. <br/>Industry-Institute interaction is vital for the development of any engineering student. This event is the ideal eye-opener for them to apply their skills and knowledge and come up with creative solutions to problems posed by the industry. In this event, a renowned Chemical firm puts forward a technical problem which they are facing. The problem may be either recurring one or a one off issue. . The participants are expected to come up with innovative &amp; economically feasible solutions that can be assimilated in the company&rsquo;s process.<br/>The previous editions had us collaborating with the likes of Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals Limited (MRPL), Mangalore Chemical and Fertilizers (MCF) and other esteemed companies. <br/>So what are you thinking of?<br/>Come, participate and get to interact with and thereby learn from the professionals!<br/>Engineer 2013, the expectations get bigger and the stakes higher! <br/>We will get back to you with further details.

A good engineer is a person who makes a design that works with as few original ideas as possible. There are no prima donnas in engineering.” -Freeman Dyson</blockquote><br /><br/><br />After memorable stint with MRPL last year, we are back this year with the Industry defined problem. We are proud to have BASF as our sponsor for IDP’13. With more than 110,000 employees, six Verbund sites, approximately 380 additional production sites and headquartered in Ludwigshafen, Germany, BASF is largest chemical company in the World. BASF Mangalore is largest production site in South Asia and is involved in the production of performance chemicals (leather and textile chemicals), dispersions and paper chemicals, automotive and coil coatings and construction chemicals. <br /><br/><br />Butadiene is an unsaturated hydrocarbon which is produced by cracking naphtha. Butadiene is mainly used in the tyre, paper and plastics industry. Important characteristics of Butadiene are: highly flammable, toxic, colorless, aromatic smell.<br /><br />BASF uses 20, 20 ton tankers per month. Each of them is at 3.5 bar pressure before unloading, after which they reach 1 bar. The main aim is maximum recovery so your task is to find out the percentage recovery in each tanker, measures to recover and changes to be made to enhance recovery.<br/>Come take part in this Year’s Edition of IDP, with innovative and creative solutions to the challenge posed. The stakes are Higher!!<br /><a href='./data/IDP.pdf'>Download</a></p></div>
