This could either be a completely new technology that you have developed or an improvement or modification of an existing technology that could cover 1 or more of the following aspects :<br/>• Safe &amp; Reliable – Making new or modifying existing solutions to make quality energy available and its usage at every household safe for man, machine &amp; environment.<br/>• Efficient – Innovative solution for EFFICIENT energy usage with reduction in capital and operational expenditures.<br/>• Productive &amp; Green – Innovative solutions with good deployment speed and scalability, focused at reduced carbon footprint and ease of installation.<br/>• The solution could be in the form of product development or an idea presentation. <br/>The idea presented can be from any field of engineering, but ensuring that it makes a positive impact on the environment through direct use or indirectly.<br/>P.S : Since this is an innovation challenge, feel free to explore beyond the above criteria . Do go ahead and add any new avenues that you may have in mind or see your idea making a positive impact on.<br/><br/>Submitted entries will be evaluated by a panel of experts giving equal weightage to:<br/>1) How green your idea is ( positive environmental impact )<br/>2) How viable a business option it can be if implemented<br/><br/>Things you could keep in mind :<br/>• Earth friendliness<br/>• Reality friendliness<br/>• Innovations brought in <br/>• Novelty of the idea<br/>• Effectiveness of the idea</p></div><div data-role="collapsible"><h3>RULES AND GUIDELINES</h3><p>Preliminary round: <br/>Candidates interested to participate should register at www.engineer.org.in. The participants must mail an abstract of their idea (not exceeding two page) to <b>sce@engineer.org.in</b> with subject as “SCE GIC abstract” on or before 23rd october<br/>i. Submit the abstract in PDF format.<br/>ii. PDFs should include:<br/>iii. Title of the application/ product<br/>iv. College Name<br/>v. Name and details of the Team members (max 4 members)<br/>   ( contact no. and email-id of the members )<br/>vi. Problem addressed<br/>vii. Abstract max 2 pages ( excluding the above )<br/><br/>Selected teams will be informed through mail.<br/>Final round:<br/>i. The final round will involve the short-listed teams to give a presentation of their idea before a jury panel covering all the aspects of their innovation.<br/>ii. The presentation wiil be for a duration of about 12 minutes which will befollowed by a Q&amp;A secession from the judges .<br/>iii. The teams could showcase any type of prototype made or simulations / surveys conducted as a part of the presentation.<br/>Areas of evaluation for the finale will be shared with the selected teams 2 days prior tothe main event (scheduled tentatively on 24thOctober, 2013.<br/><br/><b>Prizes worth 10k to be won.</b></p></div><div data-role="collapsible"><h3>FAQS</h3><p>Q. What is the maximum size of a team? <br/>A. The team can comprise of a maximum of 4 members.<br/><br/>Q. Can the participating team comprise of only 1 member?<br/>A. Yes<br/><br/>Q. Can teams be formed by mixing students of different disciplines/departments?<br/>A. Yes<br/><br/>Q. Can teams be formed by mixing undergraduate and post-graduate engineering students?<br/>A. No. This contest is only open for undergraduate engineering students.<br/><br/>Q. Can one team submit more than one entry?<br/>A. Yes, one team can send more than one entry.<br/><br/>Q. Whom do we contact in case of any queries?<br/>A. In case of any queries, send a mail sce@engineer.org.in or refer to the Contact Us List which appears on every page.<br/><br/>Q. Can entries be submitted in other languages?<br/>A. No, entries are to be submitted only in English<br/><br/>Q. Should my presentation necessarily be a solution?<br/>A. No, Your presentation can be a product proposal, changes in an existing product, a concept with a feasibility aspect, or a solution.<br/><br/>Q. Would a prototype be required if I'm a short listed candidate?<br/>A. Not necessary, but bonus points will be awarded based on level of implementation of idea which could be shown through a physical prototype or a recorded video.<br/><br/>Q. How will I know whether my entry has been short-listed or not?<br/>A. We will inform you through mail<br/><br/>The organisers retain the right to make any changes to the event, format, dates, rules and in anymatter related to this event at any time before or during the event.</p></div>
