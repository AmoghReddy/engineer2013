Fountains are a symbol of beauty and elegance.<br/>Blending these two to form a spectacular show has been made possible using audio processing<br/>techniques and basic electronic concepts.<br/> At Engineer, Symphony gives the participants an opportunity to dabble into the sights and sounds of electronics and bring the subject to life.<br/>Symphony requires participants to control a musical fountain’s water flow and lights,so that the fountain dances to the tunes of the music.<br/> A huge draw every Engineer, Symphony generates huge participation and promises a great crowd.<br/><b>SPECIFICATIONS:</b><br/><a href='./data/symphony.pdf'>Arena Specification.</a><br/><b>EVENT FORMAT</b><br/>Design an electronic controller circuit for a musical fountain.<br/>The water jets and lights on the fountain should be aesthetically harmonized with the music that is played.<br/>The fountain fitted with lights and water jet nozzles shall be provided.<br/>The water jets are controlled by solenoid valves and the lights are controlled by relay circuits.<br/>The teams have to control these lights and nozzles by digital signals, TTL compatible.<br/>The details of the fountain and the I/O specification of the circuit has been uploaded on the site.<br/>Three tunes will be played for each of the teams. One of them will be the same for all the teams. This tune will be available shortly.<br/>The second tune will be chosen by the participant team. Teams are required to submit the song in advance before the start of the event on a flash drive.<br/>The third tune will be chosen at random from the organizers’ database. Each tune shall be less than 2 minutes long.<br/>All teams coming will have to provide a 2 page abstract during the event to receive participation certificates.<br/>The abstract should contain the description of algorithm and schematics of circuits used.<br/><b>SYMPHONY TUNE:</b><br/>To be downloaded(Will be released shortly)<br/><b>RULES</b><br/>Teams can comprise of a maximum of three members.<br/>The music input is given in the form of a stereo signal to the circuit through a standard male earphone connector as line-in.<br/>The music will also be played simultaneously on the speaker.<br/>A qualification round will be conducted prior to the final competition based on which teams will be filtered.<br/>The teams will be allowed to tune their circuits during this round.<br/><b>JUDGING CRITERIA</b><br/>Synchronization with the tunes – The operation of the fountain should be in harmony with music component(s).<br/>The team shall make this clear while explaining their algorithm.<br/>(The music components can be any apparent feature such as frequency range, amplitude, a combination of frequency and amplitude, etc.) Better synchronization carries more points.<br/>Aesthetic appeal – Along with synchronization, the combination and sequence of water jets and<br/>lights should be chosen so as to create the best possible aesthetic appeal.<br/>Design of the circuit – Teams shall explain their circuit to the judges. Good quality designs shall carry more marks.<br/>Cost of the circuit – Cost of the circuit should be kept at minimum. Higher the cost of the circuit, lesser the points.<br/>The abstract will be used for judging in case of a tie.<br/>At any point of time during the event, the judges can change the rules to maintain fairness and the spirit of healthy competition.<br/>Decisions made by the judges will be final and binding.<br/></p></div>
