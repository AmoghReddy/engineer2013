Well, imagine no more, because that’s exactly what Megapixel is. A 32x16 LED screen is hung off a building as the screen with players sitting about half a kilometer away from it. The players get to choose from a wide variety of commonly played video games all coded specifically to fit this screen. The screen is also used for displaying custom messages intended to advertise and publicize other events. The game mechanics involves controlling LED arrays and coding games specific to the event. The Megapixel was initially implemented as a 24x16 LED screen in the year 2011. In the following year, this was improved to a 32x16 screen."},
"Blitzkrieg": {"image": "./Icons_Final/blitzkrieg.png","contact": "Jacob: <br/> jacobv1992@gmail.com","Description": "Blitzkrieg (also Laser Tag) draws inspiration from the popular Laser tag game. It is a team sport where players attempt to score points by tagging opponents with a hand-held IR-emitting laser-targeting device. IR-sensitive targets are worn by each player and points are won by tagging an opponent and lost when tagged. Fluorescent jackets are worn to be spotted in the dark and existing buildings are used as the arena. Each player is given limited lives and shots, after which they need to go to the base station to be revived. The game mechanics mainly involves communication protocols for integration between the player's equipment and devices in the facility."},

These visualizations are 3-dimensional and hence make it way cooler than any visualization you’ve seen before. It involves sound (signal) processing, multiplexing LEDs and building the structure (cube of LEDs) in itself. The second time Octet was implemented, it was improved structurally. A sophisticated coding system was developed and the platform was changed to MSP430F1612 from Arduino. Better patterns were implemented with the new system put in place. ",
"Waterfall": "Waterfall is a part of the Psychedelic Room. It displays visualizations synchronized with the music being played in the room. The waterfall has columns with three levels of LED rows and is filled with thermocol balls and fan underneath. These fans rotate according to the music being played so as to control how high the thermocol balls fly and the LEDs light accordingly make it look like an equalizer. It involves signal (sound) processing and controlling the fan rotation. Inclusion of LED rows was a development from the year 2011 to 2012, other than implementation on a sturdier mechanical structure. ",

Along the same lines, the Theremin implemented is modeled as a butler, with sensors for hands, depicted as vocalizing according to the user’s movements. Instead of the antennas, here, the distance of the user’s hands from the two sensors control the pitch and the amplitude. It also consists of two knobs to control mode and volume. The game mechanics involves sensing motion and using that as a basis to emit sounds. ",
"Laser_Harp": "Laser harp is an engineer’s attempt to draw analogy with the musical instrument harp. Being a high profile feature of concerts of famous musicians, here, laser beams are blocked instead of plucking strings and sound is emitted by detecting which laser was blocked using sensors. The game mechanics involve accurate alignment of the laser and sensor placed on opposite ends of the harp and producing sound of various frequencies according to the laser beam blocked. "

"Automata":{"image": "./Icons_Final/AUTOMATA_NEW.png","contact": "Nanda Kumar <br/> nanda9045@gmail.com","Description": "Robotics has advanced in ways that we had never imagined.<br/>This attitude of innovation is what inspires ‘AUTOMATA’, the flagship event of ENGINEER.<br/> AUTOMATA is back, to taunt you with a challenging problem statement. Get ready to be surprised this year with a twist that you would never have thought of.<br/> \
The ultimate image processing event. Build an autonomous robot and guide it, with only the help of images<br/>acquired from an overhead camera, from the start position on an arena to the end position following a specific path.<br/>The ‘Specified Path’ is your problem, code is your solution.</br>\
Number of members in a team: max 4<br/>\
<b>Problem Statement<br/>\
Arena Details</b> \
The arena will be a non-reflective surface on top of a wooden base.<br/> \
An overhead camera is positioned on top of the arena so that it is completely visible. The position of the camera with respect to the arena will be fixed.<br/>\
The arena consists of a white background with square nodes at certain points. One of the nodes is the finish node, and will be marked in RED, while the rest of the nodes will be BLACK.<br/>\
The nodes are inter-connected by BLACK “paths”(there may not be a direct connection between every given pair of nodes).<br/>\
Picture to be uploaded soon<br/>\
<b>Objectives</b> \
The robot has to traverse through the arena, to reach the RED node, from a specified node, using the shortest path available.<br/>\
Reaching the final node, without traversing the shortest path, may be considered for evaluation only no robot ever moves ahead on the shortest available path.<br/> \
The only input to you will be the stream from the overhead camera feed.<br/>\
The robot can move ahead only on the paths connecting the nodes.<br/>\
ONLY DC MOTORS are allowed. Steppers and wheel encoders will lead to disqualification of the team.<br/>\
There will be a maximum of 15 minutes for each team in which they can have as many trials as required. Teams will also be given 10 minutes for calibration.<br/>\
All teams must submit their bots, codes, or laptops at the start of the competition.<br/>\
<b>Scoring Criteria</b>\
The best time is taken in consideration.<br/> \
Any deviation from path will lead to restart of trial.<br/> \
In case of no one completing the traversal of arena, the team who has gone the farthest will win.<br/> \
The scoring is time-based and the team which finishes first wins.<br/> \
Illegal robot movements will result in a restart of the trial (Example: Deviation from the paths).<br/> \
The trial starts when the robot starts moving from the initial position as mentioned in the figure.<br/> \
The trial ends when the robot reaches the destination or if the stipulated time ends.<br/>\
The team will be penalized every time the robot deviates from the path.<br/>\
<b>Robot Details</b><br/>\
The robot should be completely autonomous.<br/> \
The robot should fit into a box of dimensions 20x18 (length x width).<br/>\
The robot is required to have an onboard power source not based on combustion.<br/> \
The maximum voltage between any two points on the robot should not exceed 12 volts.<br/> \
The robots are NOT allowed to have stepper motors, sensors for a wheel encoder and any other sensors.<br/> \
The robots can communicate with a computer outside the arena either through wired or wireless connection.<br/> \
In case of a wired connection, the wire must be kept slack all the time and must emerge from the top of the robot.<br/> \
Use of on-board camera is not allowed.<br/> The following software for image processing are allowed:<br/><ul><li>Open CV</li><li>MATLAB</li> <li>Scilab / GNU Octave</li></ul><br/> \
If any other software is used for image processing, please inform us.<br/> \
Softwares with ready-made image processing codes/GUIs is not allowed.<br/>\
Sharp objects on the robot which may damage the arena will lead to disqualification of the team.<br/>\
<b>Camera Details</b><br/>\
An overhead USB camera is placed such that the entire arena is just visible. <br/>\
The camera provided by us will support image acquisition in these modes: 640x480, 1600x1200 and in RGB/YUV formats.<br/> \
The teams will have to use the camera provided by us. <br/>\
<b>General Information</b><br/>\
A maximum of 4 members per team is allowed. We do not provide computers to the participating teams. It is expected that you arrange for your own.<br/>\
The robot will initially be placed in a node of our choice. The starting node may be different for different teams.<br/>\

switching walls at the check-lines indicated in the arena diagram", 
"Specifications": "The check-lines (except the third check-line) are placed such that the bot, if switched successfully, <br/>\
has to negotiate only ‘L’ shaped 90 degree turns. <br/>\
There are two paths that the participant can choose to solve the maze <br/>\
1. Original path <br/>\
2. Shortcut path <br/>\
The original path involves only wall switching at check-lines (except for the 3rdcheck-line which needs to be ignored) and a single type of ‘L’ shaped corners. <br/>\
The shortcut path is similar to the original path, but involves negotiation of a left-turn at the 3rd check-line to follow the wall including the familiar ‘L’ shaped 90 degree turn.",

"Arena": "1. The arena comprises of 15cm high walls in the form of a small maze. The wall will be in\
white color. <br/>\
2. The track may contain the following elements <br/>\
a) Straight Stretches <br/>\
b) 90 degree turns.<br/>\
c) Check-lines: White strips perpendicular to the direction of navigation indicating wall\
switch. <br/>\
3. The base of the arena is painted in black except for the check-lines. <br/>\
4. A shortcutroute (the third white strip from entrance) is also provided for teams which can <br/>\
