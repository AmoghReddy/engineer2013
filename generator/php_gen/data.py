Well, imagine no more, because that’s exactly what Megapixel is. A 32x16 LED screen is hung off a building as the screen with players sitting about half a kilometer away from it. The players get to choose from a wide variety of commonly played video games all coded specifically to fit this screen. The screen is also used for displaying custom messages intended to advertise and publicize other events. The game mechanics involves controlling LED arrays and coding games specific to the event. The Megapixel was initially implemented as a 24x16 LED screen in the year 2011. In the following year, this was improved to a 32x16 screen."},

It is a team sport where players attempt to score points by tagging opponents with a hand-held IR-emitting laser-targeting device. IR-sensitive targets are worn by each player and points are won by tagging an opponent and lost when tagged. Fluorescent jackets are worn to be spotted in the dark and existing buildings are used as the arena. Each player is given limited lives and shots, after which they need to go to the base station to be revived.

These visualizations are 3-dimensional and hence make it way cooler than any visualization you’ve seen before. It involves sound (signal) processing, multiplexing LEDs and building the structure (cube of LEDs) in itself. The second time Octet was implemented, it was improved structurally. A sophisticated coding system was developed and the platform was changed to MSP430F1612 from Arduino. Better patterns were implemented with the new system put in place. ",
"Waterfall": "Waterfall is a part of the Psychedelic Room. It displays visualizations synchronized with the music being played in the room. The waterfall has columns with three levels of LED rows and is filled with thermocol balls and fan underneath. These fans rotate according to the music being played so as to control how high the thermocol balls fly and the LEDs light accordingly make it look like an equalizer. It involves signal (sound) processing and controlling the fan rotation.

 <br/> 9538703009","Introduction":"Even during these modern days when ships are equipped with advanced technological devices, oil spills continue to be a major threat to the marine environment. With vast number of people dependant on coastal areas for fishing and tourism throughout the world, consequences of oil spills can be serious. Oil companies and ship builders shoulder the responsibility to prevent these disasters. Most man made oil pollution comes from land based activities. But public attention tends to focus more sharply on sea going oil tankers. In general, lighter refined petroleum products like diesel and gasoline are more likely to mix in water and are more toxic to marine life. These products evaporate quickly and do not persist long in the environment. However, heavier crude oil of less toxicity can remain on water surface for much longer period. As oil is lighter than water and doesn&rsquo;t decompose, it will remain on the surface for a very long time. As it is flammable, spills can also fuel ocean fires. <br />\
For this year&rsquo;s edition of Engineer, Contraption provides an opportunity for participants to furnish innovative solutions for oil spills on a miniature scale, based on the criteria in Problem Statement.<br />", 
"Problem Statement": "A pond of water having an exposed surface area of 0.25 m2 is covered by a layer of oil. Participants are required to come up with a mechanism that will recover the oil layer from the water. Dimensions of the model, as viewed from above should not exceed 25 cm x 25 cm over the surface of the pond. There is no constraint on the material of construction or the height of the model.<br />" , 
"Rules": "• The students must carry valid student ID cards of their \
college which they will be required to produce at the time of \
registration. <br />\
• A team may comprise a maximum of four participants. \
Readymade kits are NOT allowed. Judges decision in this \

Number of members in a team: max 4<br/>\
<b>Problem Statement</b><br/>\
Arena Details<br/> \
The arena will be a non-reflective surface on top of a wooden base.<br/> \
An overhead camera is positioned on top of the arena so that it is completely visible. The position of the camera with respect to the arena will be fixed.<br/>\
The arena consists of a white background with square nodes at certain points. One of the nodes is the finish node, and will be marked in RED, while the rest of the nodes will be BLACK.<br/>\
The nodes are inter-connected by BLACK “paths”(there may not be a direct connection between every given pair of nodes).<br/>\
Picture to be uploaded soon<br/>\
<b>Objectives</b> \
The robot has to traverse through the arena, to reach the RED node, from a specified node, using the shortest path available.<br/>\
Reaching the final node, without traversing the shortest path, may be considered for evaluation only no robot ever moves ahead on the shortest available path.<br/> \
The only input to you will be the stream from the overhead camera feed.<br/>\
The robot can move ahead only on the paths connecting the nodes.<br/>\
ONLY DC MOTORS are allowed. Steppers and wheel encoders will lead to disqualification of the team.<br/>\
There will be a maximum of 15 minutes for each team in which they can have as many trials as required. Teams will also be given 10 minutes for calibration.<br/>\
All teams must submit their bots, codes, or laptops at the start of the competition.<br/><b>Robot Details</b><br/>\
The robot should be completely autonomous.<br/> \
The robot should fit into a box of dimensions 20x18 (length x width).<br/>\
The robot is required to have an onboard power source not based on combustion.<br/> \
The maximum voltage between any two points on the robot should not exceed 12 volts.<br/> \
The robots are NOT allowed to have stepper motors, sensors for a wheel encoder and any other sensors.<br/> \
The robots can communicate with a computer outside the arena either through wired or wireless connection.<br/> \
In case of a wired connection, the wire must be kept slack all the time and must emerge from the top of the robot.<br/> \
Use of on-board camera is not allowed.<br/> The following software for image processing are allowed:<br/><ul><li>Open CV</li><li>MATLAB</li> <li>Scilab / GNU Octave</li></ul><br/> \

"Specifications": "The check-lines (except the third check-line) are placed such that the bot, if switched successfully, <br/>\
has to negotiate only ‘L’ shaped 90 degree turns. <br/>\
There are two paths that the participant can choose to solve the maze <br/>\
1. Original path <br/>\
2. Shortcut path <br/>\
The original path involves only wall switching at check-lines (except for the 3rdcheck-line which needs to be ignored) and a single type of ‘L’ shaped corners. <br/>\
The shortcut path is similar to the original path, but involves negotiation of a left-turn at the 3rd check-line to follow the wall including the familiar ‘L’ shaped 90 degree turn.\

"Arena": "1. The arena comprises of 15cm high walls in the form of a small maze. The wall will be in\
white color. <br/>\
2. The track may contain the following elements <br/>\
a) Straight Stretches <br/>\
b) 90 degree turns.<br/>\
c) Check-lines: White strips perpendicular to the direction of navigation indicating wall\
switch. <br/>\
3. The base of the arena is painted in black except for the check-lines. <br/>\
4. A shortcutroute (the third white strip from entrance) is also provided for teams which can <br/>\

SPARSH stands out from the rest of the events in the sense that the team SPARSH will continue to be a part of the project and the implementation of the solutions even after Engineer comes to an end and continue its technical support to the organization.<br/>This year, Sparsh will be organized in assosiation with Mangalore City Corporation and Rotary Club.",
"Introduction":"An estimated 2.5 billion people in developing countries rely on biomass, such as fuel wood, charcoal, agricultural waste and animal dung, to meet their energy needs for cooking. It is expected that one-third of the world&rsquo;s population still relies on these fuels till 2030.<br />\
Use of biomass is not in itself a cause for concern. However, when resources harvested are unsustainable and energy conversion technologies are inefficient, there are serious adverse consequences for people&rsquo;s health, the environment and economic development.<br />\
 <br />\
About 1.3 million people &ndash; mostly women and children&ndash; die prematurely every year because of exposure to indoor air pollution from biomass burning. Environmental damage can also result, for example, in deforestation. <br />\
","NeedOfTheHour":"There is an urgent need for alternative, sustainable energy sources and improved sanitation. By converting animal manure and human excreta into cooking energy, biogas could fill the void.<br />\
This problem is most directly solved by household level bio-gas plants which are being manufactured in India. However, the plants cost INR.15,000. This puts a break to the sales of these bio-gas plants as these plants are mainly targeted to the rural people who may not be willing to pay this price. The need of the hour is to make these bio-gas plants cheaper so that everybody can afford. <br />\
","problemstatement":"The participants of Sparsh are expected to give ideas through which household level bio-gas plants can be made cost-effectively with a budget which should not exceed INR 15,000. The aim is to make the household bio-gas plants as cost-effective as possible. The participants are required to make a presentation of their ideas. They are judged on the cost-effectiveness of their idea and the practicality of their solution. They will be judged by professionals experienced in this domain. Innovative and feasible ideas may be implemented and further developed by Mangalore City Corporation. <br />\
<br />\
The presentation must address the following:<br />\
Total budget, including costs of raw materials and labour<br />\
Detailed design, with justification<br />\
Any other innovative ideas to improve functionality or add new features<br />\
","Rules":"<b>Preliminary round: </b><br />\

Spinning weapons which do not come in contact with the arena at no point of time are allowed. In no case should the arena be damaged by any bot. Violation of this rule will lead to immediate disqualification.&#160;<br/>\
","safety":"Compliance with all event rules is mandatory. It is expected that competitors stay within the rules and procedures of their own accord and do not require constant policing.<br/>\
If you have a robot or weapon design that does not fit within the categories set forth in the above said rules or is in some way ambiguous or borderline, please contact the event organizers.<br/>\
Safe innovation is always encouraged, but surprising the event staff with your brilliant exploitation of a loophole may cause your robot to be disqualified before it even competes.<br/>\
Each event has safety inspections. It is at the judge&rsquo;s sole discretion that your robot is allowed to compete. As a builder you are obligated to disclose all operating principles and potential dangers to the inspection staff.<br/>\
Proper activation and deactivation of robots is critical. Robots must only be activated in the arena, testing areas, or with express consent of the event coordinators.<br/>\
All weapons must have a safety cover on any sharp edges.<br/>\
All participants build and operate robots at their own risk. Combat robotics is inherently dangerous. There is no amount of regulation that can encompass all the dangers involved.<br/>\
Please take care to not hurt yourself or others when building, testing and competing.<br/>\

"General Rules": " The students must carry valid student ID cards of their college which they should produce at the time of registration.<br/>\
A team may comprise a maximum of FIVE participants.<br/>\
The team is not permitted to compete with more than one car.<br/>\
Teams will not be allowed to modify their car during their trial. Prizes:<br/> 1st: Rs. 10,000<br/> 2nd: Rs. 7,500<br/> 3rd: Rs. 5,000<br /><b>Schedule</b><br /> Day 3 (26) Main ground <br /> Reserve day: Day 4 (27)",
 "Event Format": "The event will have 6 rounds:\
<br/>\
<b>Car Judging</b>: The car will be scrutinized by the organizers to make sure it conforms\
to the specified rules. There will be no points from this round. However, if the vehicle \
doesn’t conform to all the rules, it will be immediately disqualified.<br/> <b>Maneuverability Test</b>: Each car will have to maneuver a set of obstacles and points will be awarded based on time taken to complete the course.<br/><b>Acceleration Test</b>: Each car will have to accelerate a certain distance and points will be awarded based on the time taken to complete the stretch.<br/><b>Quarter-Finals</b>: 8 quarter-Finalists will be decided based on their aggregate points obtained in the abstract submission, acceleration test and maneuverability test. 4 groups of 2 cars each will race and the first car proceeds to the next round.<br/><b>Semi-Finals</b>: 4 semi-finalists will be divided into 2 groups and race-off for the 2 spots in the finals. <br/><b>Final</b>: This round requires the final 2 cars to race through a track with acute curvesand obstructions with the cars able pit stops for refueling and repairs. The endurance of the car will be tested. <br/><a href='./data/velocity.pdf'>Event Rule</a> ",

"Event Rules":"The final 3 rounds will have races with multiple cars racing at a time.<br/>\
The track will have check points at regular intervals. If a machine tumbles, or halts, \
or goes off the arena at any point on the track, one of the team members is allowed to \
lift it up and place it at the nearest checkpoint behind that point. The clock will keep \
running during this time.<br/> Only ONE member of the team will be allowed to run along \
with the car throughout each race.<br/>\
 Team members are not permitted to touch either their machines or those of their \
opponents once the race begins (unless there is a need to lift the machine as stated in \
second point). The penalty for doing so is disqualification.<br/>\
 If any of the machines starts off before the flag is waved, the counter would be \
restarted and the machines will get a second chance. However, if any machine starts \
off before the waving of flag (or countdown) for a second time, it will be disqualified. <br/>\
No re-match will be offered for the second time.<br/>\
 The machines are not allowed to leave any loose parts on any part of the arena. Any \
machine disintegrating during the race will be disqualified.<br/>\
 Teams are not allowed to purposefully damage the machine of the opponent's team. \
If found doing so on track (while racing), the concerned team will be disqualified. <br/>\
Execution of last three rules will be subjective and relies completely on judges' \
discretion.","Arena Specs":" The design of the track will be updated periodically. ( Make a note to check out the \
website periodically)<br/>\
The actual track during the time of race might not strictly follow the design shown \
above.<br/>\
The width of the track varies from 0.5 m to a maximum of 2mts.",
"Car Specs":" Machine should fit in a box of dimensions 500 mm x 500 mm x 400 mm (L X B X \
H) at any moment of time during the race.<br/> The height will be measured excluding the \
antenna. The external device which is used to control the machine is not included in \
the size constraint.<br/>\
 The machine should be controlled by a wireless remote control mechanism \
throughout the race.<br/>\
 The machine must not be made from Lego parts, or any ready-made assembly \
kits other than the parts mentioned below.<br/> Readily available chassis layouts are \
not allowed. Any machine found having a readymade chassis will be immediately \
disqualified.<br/>\
 The machine may be roughly classified into structural and functional parts:<br/>\
 <b>Structural parts</b> - Chassis, shock mounting members and have to be built by the \
participants themselves.<br/> <img src='data/velocity1.JPG'/> <br/> <b>Functional Parts</b> – Stock Steering mechanism must not be used and suspension \
(lower excluding suspension spring and shock absorbers) has to be built by the \
participants themselves.<br/> Steering mechanisms have to be compulsorily built by \
the participants.<br/>\
 Judging for the same will be strict and the participant will be immediately disqualified \
if any of the above structural components are found to be ready made.<br/>\
 The tires used must have a minimum diameter of 3 inches. You are advised to use \
tyres of good width for better performance on dirt tracks.<br\> <img src='data/velocity2.JPG'/><br/> <b>Please note: It is not compulsory to fabricate the brake mechanism.</b><br/><b>Wheel Hub:</b> Any part rigidly attached to the wheel hub will be considered as a part of \
it and hence can be ready-made. An example here is that of the ball stud. <img src='data/velocity3.JPG'/> <br/><b> Steering Mechanism:</b> Any part which is connected to steering rod rigidly i.e. has \
no degrees of freedom with respect to steering rod (example: heim joint http://\
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heim_joint) will be considered as part of steering rod and thus \
has to be fabricated by participants.<br/><img src='data/velocity4.JPG' /><br/><b> Suspension mechanism:</b> Any part rigidly connected to suspension arms or one with \
no degrees of freedom with respect to suspension arm will be considered as its part \
and has to be fabricated by the participants, except the upper suspension arm. For \
example both the heim joint (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rod_end_bearing -see this \
for more information) for the upper suspension arm and the stud rigidly connected to \
the wheel hub can be bought from the market.<br/><img src='data/velocity5.JPG' /><br/>If there are parts used in the concerned joint which are neither rigidly connected with \
suspension or the hub, steering system or hub; they can be used readymade from the \
market.<br/>\
 If teams get any part specifically manufactured for them, they are required to \
present the CAD Drawings given to the manufacturer and the manufacturer’s \
bill for the same.<br/>\
 The Chassis has to be strictly built by the team and use of stock chassis will lead \
to immediate disqualification.<br/>\
The above pictures are just sample pictures for you to understand the rules easily.",
"Propulsion & Steering":" The machine must use only mechanical power generated by an internal combustion \
(IC) engine for propulsion.<br/> Only one IC engine should be used in the machine.<br/> Use of \
any other sources such as chemicals, compressed gas, rockets etc. is not allowed.<br/>The \
maximum allowed capacity of IC engine to be used is 5 cc.<br/><img src='data/velocity6.JPG' /><br/>  Any machine which uses DC Motors for propulsion will be disqualified. However \
DC motors and servos can be used for steering mechanisms or any other control \
mechanisms apart from propulsion.<br/>\
 The machine must have an on-board power supply to run any mechanism requiring \
electric power.<br/>\
 The electric voltage anywhere in the machine should not exceed 15V at any point of \
time.<br/>\
 There shall be a countdown preceding the start of the race. No participant is allowed \
to touch the machine during the countdown period.<br/>\
 Providing a clutch mechanism between the engine and the wheel would prove useful, \
as it would prevent the engine from dying out at any stage of the race.<br/>\
 Participants are advised to use a proper cooling mechanism to prevent overheating of \
the engine.<br/>\
 Participants are advised to use sway bars for better control and stability.<br/>\
 The participants are advised to use proper air filters as dirt might cause serious \
problems to the engine.<br/>\
 Readymade wheels are allowed.<br/>\
 The machine will be inspected and if found to be dangerous, the team will be \
disqualified. This decision rests solely with the judges and the organizers."}
